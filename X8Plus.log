Tricks:
I tried doing the Pixhawk setups several times down in the basement of GGBrown building, but I failed everytime. Most of times, I got stuck in the Compass Calibration step, Onboard Mag Calibration never works, Sometimes even Accel Calibration failed. I finally went outside near the old GGBrown Building, and set the fitness of Onboard Mag Calibration to Relaxed and it magically works out. GPS works fine and shows my location.
